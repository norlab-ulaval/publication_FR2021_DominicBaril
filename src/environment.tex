\section{Environment}
\label{sec:env}

The main focus of this work is deploy our \ac{LTR} framework in a subarctic environment and evaluate it's performance when subject to complex weather conditions.
In order to do so, we conducted our deployments within the \textit{Montmorency} boreal forest, located \SI{70}{km} North of \quebec~city, Canada.
Characteristics of boreal forests include dense closed-crown conifer vegetation~\citep{Russell1988} and long, cold winters leading to a high snow cover on the ground.
Dense vegetation is known to cause an issue for real-time mapping due to static antenna signal being blocked for \ac{RTK} \ac{GNSS}~\citep{Babin2019}.
Snow cover, illumination variation and the uniformity of the environment are also known to be challenging for vision-based approaches~\citep{Paton2017}.
Three different one-way paths were defined, all link 2 \acp{POI}.
The A  and B paths link the Garage and \laverdiere~\acp{POI} through cross-country ski trails, measuring \SI{1.5}{km} and \SI{1.5}{km} respectively.
In order to maximize \ac{UGV} and prevent immobilization, the A and B paths was previously driven on by a snowmobile operator.
The C path connects the Garage and Gazebo \acp{POI} mostly in a larger road network, measuring \SI{0.6}{km}.
The path network is illustrated in~\autoref{fig:forest}.

		We see the three different paths, both the A (\SI{1.5}{km}) and B path ({1.5}{km}) going from the garage \ac{POI} to the \laverdiere~\ac{POI}, while the C path (\SI{0.6}{km}) goes to the Gazebo \ac{POI}.

During the five days deployment, we completed a total of 14 repeat runs split between all paths, going in both directions.
The last repeat run was started a little under \SI{72}{h} after it's respective teach run. 
During the deployment week, our \ac{LTR} system was subject to fluctuating weather, ranging from snowstorm to heavy rain, with temperatures going from \SI{-10}{\celsius} to \SI{10}{\celsius}, as shown in~\autoref{fig:meteo_runs}.
We also deployed our system during daytime and nighttime, with varying cloud coverage.
More details about each run are given in~\autoref{tab:all_runs}.

		All times are defined in the local Eastern Standard Time. 
		The column $\Delta t$ defines the elapsed time since the teach run of the associated path.
		The column \# $\readpc$ shows the number of scans for each run, with each scan consisting of \SI{64 000}{} points.}
